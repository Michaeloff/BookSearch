# Book Search Web Tool

This project is an Angular-based online book searching tool in development for future addition to the educational site: [bigbrainjunction.org](https://bigbrainjunction.org)

A working version of the tool so far is visible on this GitHub Page: https://michaeloff.github.io/BookSearch

The REST APIs used are primarily Google's Book API (https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes) and potentially this Open Library API (https://openlibrary.org/api/books), esp. for higher res book covers.
